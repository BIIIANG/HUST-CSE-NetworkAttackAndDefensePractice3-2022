/*
 * This file demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS-MPU.  It creates tasks in both
 * User mode and Privileged mode, and using both the xTaskCreate() and
 * xTaskCreateRestricted() API functions.  The purpose of each created task is
 * documented in the comments above the task function prototype (in this file),
 * with the task behaviour demonstrated and documented within the task function
 * itself.
 *
 * In addition a queue is used to demonstrate passing data between
 * protected/restricted tasks as well as passing data between an interrupt and
 * a protected/restricted task.  A software timer is also used.
